Count Words in a String â€“ Counts the number of individual words in a string. 
For added complexity read these strings in from a text file and generate a

1. how to ignore text inside triple quotes
test2 = " '''hello''' does this work "
try1 = re.findall(r'[^"{3}\w"{3}]+', test2)    
2. how to ignore variable
